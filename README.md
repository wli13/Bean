### Rationality for Choice of V2
We looked to find the most robust, clear and efficient code with prioritization on the robustness. After comparing the code, we decided to use Wenting's code with slight modifications added to it from the other codes since her code embodies most of the characteristics that we were looking for and uses the methods of the ArrayList to write the methods of APQ proficiently and clearly. 

### Time Complexity of Each Method
* add() O(1) - amortized constant time
* isEmpty() O(1) - constant time
* peekMin() O(n) - linear time
* removeMin() O(n) - linear time
